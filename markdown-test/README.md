## Markdown-Test
This repository is just a test ground to test `markdown files` such as `README.md`.</br>
One might ask, why not use other online services for testing?</br>
Actually it's just that I prefer to use Github website.

## Installation
I use `Android's Termux` to develop apps. So these code really helps me.
1. Install `Termux:API` from [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.termux.api).
2. In `Android's Termux`, install the `api` using:
```
apt install termux-api
```

## Usage
1. Use `cat` to produce output in `cli` and capture the output using:
```
cat {filename} | termux-clipboard-set
```
2. Paste the `clipboard` to `root/markdown-test/test/change-me.md`
